# Autopilotbar
This is a simple info bar to display some autopilot parameters with Flow Pro in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.

#Attention, please read carefully.
This is a Flow-Pro widget in the development stage. 

#Installation:
Unzip to the community folder. The next time you start the sim, you should be able to find the widget under "Community/Hud". From there, move the info bar into the circle.
#Update:
Remove the previous version from the community folder and also deactivate and delete the (old) widget from the circle.
Customize layout: Size, background color, transparency and placement of the info bar as well as font color and size can be adjusted relatively easily in the CSS section of the addon. Feel free to experiment here. See further notes at the end.

I may continue to work on this widget. This is my first (and only) widget. The code seems clean and it works.
Special thanks to "plerzelwupp". I used your code and details from p42-util-flow-plerzelwupp-infobar (https://de.flightsim.to/file/51551/poor-man-s-info-bar-for-flow) as inspiration and blueprint.

#Usage
This widget shows some information about the autopilot. It focuses on the information I need for my flights, so it may be less useful especially for sophisticated flights and experienced pilots. It may also not work with complex airplanes (e.g. Airbus and Boing with multiple AP slots). I only flew and tested it with the C-160 Transall by Azurpoly.
It makes sense for me as I use a Behringer X-Touch Mini with SPAD.neXt to adapt the autopilot. The values are visible in the cockpit (I rarely use) and in FlowPro (but to large).
I intend to adapt my AP in group flights a bit better.
